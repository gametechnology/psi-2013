The new main repository for Project Stella Incognita. Please follow the guidelines from the 'GIT documentatie.pdf' file to maintain a steady workflow;

Make sure that you have installed Git Flow on your computer, which can be downloaded and installed from http://xinyustudio.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/installing-git-flow-in-windows/
Read the Git Documentation well and especially the branch section (more information can be found in the introduction of the doc), as we are going to work with the develop model
and some programs need to be installed, I recommend working with Git Bash but if you rather work with Git Extensions that should be fine as well (although some documentation
is missing).
